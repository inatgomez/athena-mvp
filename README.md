# ATHENA MVP

**Project Status: In Progress**

ATHENA is a Story Protocol-powered platform that reimagines how authors can make books freely available while increasing revenue through blockchain-enabled attribution and licensing mechanics. Instead of traditional paywalls, authors earn through automated royalty distribution when their work is legitimately remixed or referenced.

## Core Concept

**Make attribution more valuable than hiding sources** by:

- Registering books as IP assets with customizable licensing terms
- Enabling tracked attribution for derivative works at the chapter level
- Automating royalty distribution through smart contracts
- Creating discovery value through attribution graphs

## Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Story Protocol
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts integrated with Story Protocol
- **Storage**: IPFS for content files
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Project Goals

This is **pure R&D exploration**, not a commercial venture. I'm experimenting with whether blockchain-native attribution can:

- Increase author revenue compared to traditional publishing
- Encourage legitimate attribution over unauthorized copying
- Create new discovery mechanisms through derivative relationships
- Enable sustainable knowledge sharing ecosystems

## Development Status

Currently in MVP design phase focusing on:

- Story Protocol integration architecture
- PIL template customization for books
- Chapter-level attribution metadata system
- Basic author and remixer user flows
